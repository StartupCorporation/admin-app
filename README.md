## ðŸš€ Run Instructions

### Linux

Follow these steps to run the application on an Ubuntu system:

1. **Ensure the `start.sh` script has execute permissions.**

   If the script is not executable, grant the required permissions by running:
   ```bash
   chmod +x start.sh
   ```

2. **Start the application.**

   Once permissions are set, execute the script to start the application:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

## ðŸ“– OpenAPI Documentation

Once the application is running, you can access the OpenAPI documentation to explore the available APIs:

> **Note:** OpenAPI documentation is available only after the application has been started.
